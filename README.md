# Overview
This repository contains the code used in the analysis for the research paper titled "Quantifying the potential benefits of early detection for pancreatic cancer through a counterfactual simulation modeling analysis" by Park, Jiheum, et al., published in Scientific Reports in 2023.

# Purpose
Developed to investigate the advantages of early detection of pancreatic cancer, this code focuses on quantifying potential increases in life-years gained. It employs a Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) population model to simulate scenarios for individual patients based on their age and stage at diagnosis. This simulation is designed to mirror the overall cancer incidence and mortality statistics in the U.S.

A key feature of our model is the inclusion of "cancer sojourn time," a metric indicating the pace of cancer progression. This allows for the differentiation between rapid and slow progression of the disease. The premise of our study suggests that early detection—envisioned through a hypothetical screening program analyzed in a counterfactual scenario—could significantly reduce mortality rates when compared to the absence of such screening measures.
